# Car Sales Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes car sales data to identify key trends and predict future sales using a machine learning model. The goal is to leverage data analysis techniques to uncover insights and build a predictive model to assist in business decision-making.

## Data Analysis Steps
### 1. Data Loading and Transformation
- The dataset was loaded and checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Data was cleaned and transformed to ensure usability for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted correlation analysis to determine relationships between variables.
- Visualized key insights such as sales trends, customer preferences, and seasonal effects.

### 3. Data Preparation for Prediction
- Separated the dataset into independent (features) and dependent (target) variables.
- Applied encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into numerical form.
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler for better model performance.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Machine Learning Model
### Model Used: Linear Regression
- A linear regression model was trained on the dataset to predict car sales.
- The model's performance was evaluated based on standard metrics such as R-squared.

### Model Performance and Conclusion
- The model did not perform well, indicating that linear regression is not the best approach for this dataset.
- The low predictive accuracy suggests the need for alternative models, such as Decision Trees or Random Forests, which may handle complex relationships better.
- Due to poor performance, this model is not suitable for deployment.

## Next Steps
- Exploring other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting).
- Performing feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
- Collecting additional data that may improve predictive performance.
